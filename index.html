  <article>

    <p>Kevin Gibbons moved to San Francisco from Canada two years ago. He knew no one. An old friend hired him, but Kevin&#146;s real ambition was to start a company. Once an eBay PowerSeller, Kevin had shipped hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise. He remembered the agony of packaging items, finding the cheapest shipping options, and transporting packages to the nearest shipping center. He told Joshua Scott&#151;a Canadian co-worker with an equally awful network&#151;about a startup idea that could solve these problems. Joshua, also a former eBay PowerSeller, loved the idea.
    </p>

<h2><div id="starting">Overview</div></h2>

<p>The pair launched landing pages to test whether others were interested. They called the idea Shyp. Shyp would allow users to take a photo of an item that they wanted to send to someone. A Shyp rep would pick up the item, package it, and ship it through the cheapest courier. The landing pages converted incredibly well, and Kevin and Joshua began offering the service. They made pickups themselves, and collected shipment information through Google forms.</p>

<h2><div id="deciding">History</div></h2>

<p>Shyp&#146;s customers loved the service. Kevin and Joshua knew that Shyp was worth pursuing full time, but they couldn&#146;t quit their day jobs given their lack of savings and loads of debt. They decided to raise a $500,000 seed round to support themselves as they developed the company. Knowing no angel investors or VCs, they asked friends for introductions but got no where.</p>

<h2><div id="joining">Companies</div></h2>
	
<p>A few unsuccessful weeks later, Kevin watched a livestream of TechCrunch Disrupt and saw AngelList Co-Founder Naval Ravikant critique a shipping startup. Naval urged the startup&#151;which offered only a web-based solution&#151;to provide offline services such as pickups and packaging. Kevin was shocked to hear Naval essentially describe Shyp. He immediately emailed Naval and told him about Shyp. Naval loved the idea, and suggested that Shyp could be featured on AngelList, but it would first need to have a profile.</p> 

<h2><div id="creating">Investors</div></h2>

<p>Kevin and Joshua considered whether creating a profile without having any confirmed investors would look bad, <span class="pic"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NC1burg.png" width="200px"></span>but they realized that an AngelList profile would be the only way that investors could learn about them. Shyp&#146;s website was public, but it was targeted towards customers, not investors. So they created their profile and included as much detail as possible. They explained the $100 billion+ shipping market and Shyp&#146;s unique solution. They shared their vision that &#147;in the next few years we will not go to the Post Office to ship packages.&#148; Their bios included their backgrounds as eBay PowerSellers, accomplished iOS developers, and even as failed entrepreneurs. They took their time crafting each word, and made sure to share only the best product screenshots and company imagery.</p> 

<h2><div id="gaining">Gaining Momentum on AngelList</div></h2>

<p>People were impressed by Shyp&#146;s profile. Several investors reached out just to share that it was the best they&#146;ve seen. And it helped Shyp get noticed. AngelList featured Shyp, and a deluge of inbound requests to meet arrived through AngelList&#146;s messaging feature. Now limited with their time, Kevin and Joshua had to turn down many requests just to accommodate the most appealing investors.</p> 

<h2><div id="starting">Getting a Lead Investor</div></h2>

<p>One of the investors that reached out to Shyp was Homebrew&#146;s Satya Patel. Unbeknownst to Satya, Kevin had previously met with Satya&#146;s partner, Hunter Walk, when Kevin was deciding whether to start Shyp. The concept was too early and Hunter never mentioned it to Satya. Now, Shyp&#146;s AngelList profile piqued Satya&#146;s interest, so Satya asked to meet the team. Homebrew eventually offered to lead Shyp&#146;s round, and Shyp accepted. By this time, the deal generated so much interest that Shyp increased the round size from $500,000 to $1.2 million, and then again to $1.5 million. Kevin and Joshua realized that the extra capital would be crucial to meeting a surge in demand&#151;they would need hourly workers on the road, packaging materials, a warehouse, and a robust mobile app.</p>

<h2><div id="partnering">Partnering With a Syndicate</div></h2>
	
<p>Shyp had another funding surge when New York Times best-selling author Tim Ferriss offered to invest $750,000 in the company. Kevin had previously applied to Tim&#146;s Spearhead Capital fundraising competition. Shyp became a finalist, and after several due diligence meetings, Tim picked Shyp as the winner. $500,000 would come from Tim and a private group of investors that he lined up. The remaining $250,000 would come from Tim&#146;s newly launched AngelList syndicate. The syndicate would allow for &#147;accredited investors&#148; to invest in Shyp if they joined the syndicate. Tim blogged about the opportunity, and the $250,000 allotment filled up within 53 minutes.</p>

<h2><div id="closing">Closing Their Round</div></h2>

<p>By September 2013, Shyp closed their round. It totaled $2.2 million. From hardly being able to meet a single investor, Kevin and Joshua used AngelList to partner with the world&#146;s best. <span class="pic"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjwBx-BCcAACIYN.jpg:large" width="200px"></span>In addition to Homebrew and Tim Ferriss, Shyp&#146;s round included funding from Sherpa Ventures, Naval Ravikant, David Marcus (President of Paypal), Antonio Gracias (Board Member of Tesla), Aaron Batalion (Co-founder of LivingSocial), Daymond John (Shark on ABC&#146;s The Shark Tank), and several others. To boot, AngelList helped Kevin and Joshua round out their team. They met their third Co-founder&#151;Jack Smith&#151;after they were featured, and they have hired three people through AngelList&#146;s recruiting feature.</p>
